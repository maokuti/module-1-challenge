# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
 
I was motivated to recreate a webpage's style and layout in a more efficient manner that would challenge me to to condense the CSS file as much as possible without impacting the design.

I built this project to deepen my understanding of HTML but more specifically to become more familiar with how different CSS selectors and their properties can be used to style a webpage.

This project reworked the CSS to make it more efficient through the consolidation of CSS selectors and proprties and reorganisation to follow the semantic strucutre of HTML elements. This improves the codebase's long-term sustainability.

I learned using semantic HTML elements makes web pages more informative and it also allows browsers and search ingeines to better interpret content. I also learned how the consolidation of CSS selectors etc allows for anyone seeking to make edits to do so efficiently with wholesale or targeted changes depending on requirements.
